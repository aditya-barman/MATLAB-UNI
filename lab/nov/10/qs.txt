1. Use anonymous function in MATLAB, plot the following functions by passing arguments a, b, c to the function:

f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c; -25 <= x <= 25

with
(i) a = -3.9, b = 52, c = 0
(ii) a = 1.3, b = 0.2, c = 30

2. Passing a user-defined function to quad in MATLAB, to evaluate

integrate (g*cos(wt))dt from -5 to 5, where g = 2.5, w = 10

3. Use primary function and subfunction in MATLAB to evaluate

integrate from 0 to 2 (dx/(x^3 - 2x - 5))
